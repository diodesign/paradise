## Overview

A JavaScript doodle, using [p5js](https://p5js.org/), of two animated colorful ribbons with a rotating 3D cube in front of them. This was inspired by [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) productions as well as by [Inferno](https://www.mobygames.com/game/196830/inferno/), an Acorn RISC OS action-puzzle game made by friends of mine in 1996. The ribbons seen in [this video capture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1ZMiie9ibY&t=724s) of the title screen were implemented in impressive hand-coded Arm assembly. This JavaScript recreates that real-time effect as an homage.

Also the original music, by Joe Nash, slaps.
